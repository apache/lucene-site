The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 8.0.0 and Apache Solr 8.0.0

Lucene can be downloaded from <https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html>
and Solr can be downloaded from <https://lucene.apache.org/solr/downloads.html>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

#### Query execution

Term queries, phrase queries and boolean queries introduced new optimization that enables efficient skipping over non-competitive documents when the total hit count is not needed. Depending on the exact query and data distribution, queries might run between a few percents slower and many times faster, especially term queries and pure disjunctions.

In order to support this enhancement, some API changes have been made:
 * `TopDocs.totalHits` is no longer a long but an object that gives a lower bound of the actual hit count.
 * `IndexSearcher`'s `search` and `searchAfter` methods now only compute total hit counts accurately up to 1,000 in order to enable this optimization by default.
 * Queries are now required to produce non-negative scores.

#### Codecs

 * Postings now index score impacts alongside skip data. This is how term queries optimize collection of top hits when hit counts are not needed.
 * Doc values introduced jump tables, so that advancing runs in constant time. This is especially helpful on sparse fields.
 * The terms index `FST` is now loaded off-heap for non-primary-key fields using `MMapDirectory`, reducing heap usage for such fields.

#### Custom scoring

The new `FeatureField` allows efficient integration of static features such as a pagerank into the score. Furthermore, the new `LongPoint#newDistanceFeatureQuery` and `LatLonPoint#newDistanceFeatureQuery` methods allow boosting by recency and geo-distance respectively. These new helpers are optimized for the case when total hit counts are not needed. For instance if the pagerank has a significant weight in your scores, then Lucene might be able to skip over documents that have a low pagerank value.

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

* Solr now uses HTTP/2 for inter-node communication

Being a major release, Solr 8 removes many deprecated APIs, changes various parameter defaults and behavior. Some changes may require a re-index of your content.
