The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 5.2.1 and Apache Solr 5.2.1

Lucene can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/5.2.1>
and Solr can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/solr/5.2.1>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:
* Fix class loading deadlock relating to Codec initialization, default codec and SPI discovery.
* NRT readers now reflect a new commit even if there is no change to the commit user data
* Queries now get a dummy Similarity when scores are not needed in order to not load unnecessary information like norms

### Highlights of this Solr release include:
* Fix javascript bug introduced by SOLR-7409 that breaks the dataimport screen in the admin UI
* Faceting on a numeric field with a unique() subfacet function on another numeric field can result in incorrect results or an exception
* New Facet Module should respect shards.tolerant and process all non-failing shards instead of throwing an exception
* A request with a json content type but no body caused a null pointer exception
* SolrOutputFormat creates an invalid solr.xml in the solr home zip for MapReduceIndexerTool
* Fix new (Angular-based) admin UI Cloud pane
* The DefaultSolrHighlighter since 5.0 was determining if payloads were present in a way that was slow, especially when lots of fields were highlighted. It's now fast
* Requests are not distributed evenly if the collection isn't present locally
