### Solr 7.2.0 Release Highlights:

 * More stream evaluators, including: matrix operations; spline; derivative; regression; normalization; scaling; correlation; markov chains; time series differencing; and triangular and geometric distributions.
 * The new facet.matches parameter returns facet buckets only for terms that match a regular expression.
