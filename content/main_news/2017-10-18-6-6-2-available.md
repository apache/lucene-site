### Highlights of this Solr release include:

 * Critical security fix: Fix for a 0-day exploit (CVE-2017-12629), details: https://s.apache.org/FJDl. RunExecutableListener has been disabled by default (can be enabled by -Dsolr.enableRunExecutableListener=true) and resolving external entities in the XML query parser (defType=xmlparser or {!xmlparser ... }) is disabled by default.

 * Fix a bug where Solr was attempting to load the same core twice (Error message: "Lock held by this virtual machine").
