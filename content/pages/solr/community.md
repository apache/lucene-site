## Apache Software Foundation ##

Solr is developed by contributors to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) through an open, meritocratic process that goes well beyond
simply sharing the source code.
Visit the [ASF website](https://www.apache.org/) to learn more.

## Support ##

The Solr Community provides user support for free through the [solr-user mailing list](#mailing-lists-irc) and other channels mentioned
here. There are also a number of external companies and professionals ready to help, see the user-maintained list at
[cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Support](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Support).

## Mailing Lists & IRC ##

#### Solr User List: solr-user@lucene.apache.org ####

This list is for users of Solr to ask questions, share knowledge, and discuss issues.  We strongly encourage
users to send usage and configuration questions and problems to this mailing list.  Before filing an issue in
the JIRA issue tracker, make sure it's a real bug and that it hasn't been already discovered by discussing it here.

#### Mail Archives ####

The Solr Wiki maintains a list of searchable mailing list archives at

<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/SolrResources#SolrResources-MailingListArchives>.

No endorsement is implied by the listing of an archive on the Wiki.

#### Other Mailing Lists ####

Each Lucene project maintains its own mailing lists. Please refer to the project you are interested in
for details on subscribing to its mailing list.

#### IRC  ####

There are two primary IRC channels dedicated to Solr at freenode.net.

• #solr -- Channel for Solr user questions

• #solr-dev -- Hangout for discussion of Solr development

The IRC channel can be used for online discussion about Lucene<sup>&trade;</sup>/Solr related stuff,
but developers should be careful to transfer all the official decisions or useful discussions to the issue
tracking system.  Note that the solr-user mailing list will reach a lot more people than the IRC channel,
but if it's the right time of day, the IRC channel can offer a more interactive experience with faster turnaround.

[This wiki page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/IRCChannels) has links to a web-based IRC client, and a
wealth of information about how to get the most out of the IRC channels.

#### Slack ####

The project's Slack channel is the `#lucene-dev` channel in the `the-asf` organization. Link: <https://the-asf.slack.com/messages/CE70MDPMF>

## Issue tracker ##

Solr uses the ASF JIRA instance.

You can browse, search, and create issues [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR).
Patches welcome!  This is not the correct place to start when you need support.  Problems should be
discussed on the mailing list and/or via IRC before creating an issue.

## How To Contribute ##

Looking to contribute to Solr?  Read the [instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/HowToContribute) on
contributing and then submit a patch!

## Version Control ##

The Solr source code resides in the Apache [GIT](http://git.apache.org) repository. Various GIT clients
can be obtained from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). There are also GIT integrations for various
IDEs. For Eclipse, look at [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/). IntelliJ has git support bundled, if you
have installed the command line version.

#### Web Access (read-only) ####

The source code can be browsed via the Web at <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucene-solr.git>.
No GIT client software is required.

The code can also be browsed through our GitHub mirror at <https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/>.

#### Anonymous Access (read-only) ####

The GIT URL for anonymous users is <http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene-solr.git>.
Instructions for non-committer GIT access are [here](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/#repository-checkout).

#### Committer Access (read-write) ####

The GIT URL for committers is <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene-solr.git>.
