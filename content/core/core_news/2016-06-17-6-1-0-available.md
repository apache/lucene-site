Lucene 6.1.0 Release Highlights:

New features

  * Numerous improvements to LatLonPoint, for indexing a latitude/longitude point and searching by polygon, distance or box, or finding nearest neighbors

  * Geo3D now has simple APIs for creating common shape queries, matching LatLonPoint

Optimizations

  * Faster indexing and searching of points.

  * Faster geo-spatial indexing and searching for LatLonPoint, Geo3D and GeoPoint (see http://home.apache.org/~mikemccand/geobench.html )

  * HardlinkCopyDirectoryWrapper optimizes file copies using hard links

  * In case of contention, the query cache now prefers returning an uncached Scorer rather than waiting on a lock.

Bug fixes

  * BooleanQuery could sometimes assign too low scores to ranges of documents that matched a single clause.

  * Doc values updates could sometimes be applied in the wrong order.
