The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.2.0

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly
any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and
improvements, some of which are highlighted below. The release
is available for immediate download at:

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

  * The CREATE_NEW flag is passed when creating a file to ensure Lucene is really write-once

  * Index numeric ranges (min and max value in a single field) and search by overlapping range

  * IndexWriter methods return a sequence number indicating effective order of operations across threads

  * UkrainianMorfologikAnalyzer is a new dictionary based analyzer for the Ukrainian language

  * The Polygon class can now be created from a GeoJSON string

  * Compound file creation now verifies checksum of its component files

  * Index time sorting is now a core feature, and supports dimensional points

  * StandardAnalyzer is moved to core and is the default analyzer

  * MatchNoDocsQuery now includes the reason it was created

  * QueryParser can now be told to not pre-split on whitespace

  * MMapDirectory tries harder to prevent SIGSEGV if buggy code tries to execute
    searches after the index was closed, but it's still best effort

  * MMapDirectory no longer allocates weak references to ease garbage collection

  * Conjunction (MUST, FILTER) queries are faster

  * Dimensional points have much faster (~40%) flush time and use less space in the index
