The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 5.5.0 and Apache Solr 5.5.0

Lucene can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/5.5.0>
and Solr can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/solr/5.5.0>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

* JoinUtil.createJoinQuery can now join on numeric doc values fields

* BlendedInfixSuggester now has an exponential reciprocal scoring model, to more strongly favor suggestions with matches closer to the beginning

* CustomAnalyzer has improved (compile time) type safety

* DFISimilarity implements the divergence from independence scoring model

* Fully wrap any other merge policy using MergePolicyWrapper

* Sandbox geo point queries have graduated into the spatial module, and now use a more efficient binary term encoding for smaller index size, faster indexing, and decreased search-time heap usage

* BooleanQuery performs some new query optimizations

* TermsQuery constructors are more GC efficient

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

* The schema version has been increased to 1.6, and Solr now returns non-stored doc values fields along with stored fields

* The PERSIST CoreAdmin action has been removed

* The mergePolicy element is deprecated in favor of a similar mergePolicyFactory element, in solrconfig.xml

* CheckIndex now works on HdfsDirectory

* RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin now allows wildcards in the role, and accepts an 'all' permission

* Users can now choose compression mode in SchemaCodecFactory

* Solr now supports Lucene's XMLQueryParser

* Collections APIs now have async support

* Uninverted field faceting is re-enabled, for higher performance on rarely changing indices
