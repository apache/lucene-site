The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 6.6.2

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics, rich document parsing, geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well as parallel SQL. Solr is enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable, providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

### Highlights for this Solr release includes:

 * Critical security fix: Fix for a 0-day exploit (CVE-2017-12629), details: https://s.apache.org/FJDl. RunExecutableListener has been disabled by default (can be enabled by -Dsolr.enableRunExecutableListener=true) and resolving external entities in the XML query parser (defType=xmlparser or {!xmlparser ... }) is disabled by default.

 * Fix for a bug where Solr was attempting to load the same core twice (Error message: "Lock held by this virtual machine").
