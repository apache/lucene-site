The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.2.0 and Apache Solr 6.2.0.

Lucene can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/6.2.0>
and Solr can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/solr/6.2.0>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

  * The CREATE_NEW flag is passed when creating a file to ensure Lucene is really write-once

  * Index numeric ranges (min and max value in a single field) and search by overlapping range

  * IndexWriter methods return a sequence number indicating effective order of operations across threads

  * UkrainianMorfologikAnalyzer is a new dictionary based analyzer for the Ukrainian language

  * The Polygon class can now be created from a GeoJSON string

  * Compound file creation now verifies checksum of its component files

  * Index time sorting is now a core feature, and supports dimensional points

  * StandardAnalyzer is moved to core and is the default analyzer

  * MatchNoDocsQuery now includes the reason it was created

  * QueryParser can now be told to not pre-split on whitespace

  * MMapDirectory tries harder to prevent SIGSEGV if buggy code tries to execute
    searches after the index was closed, but it's still best effort

  * MMapDirectory no longer allocates weak references to ease garbage collection

  * Conjunction (MUST, FILTER) queries are faster

  * Dimensional points have much faster (~40%) flush time and use less space in the index

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

DocValues, streaming, /export, machine learning

  * DocValues can now be used with BoolFields

  * Date and boolean support added to /export handler

  * Add "scoreNodes" streaming graph expression

  * Support parallel ETL with the "topic" expression

  * Feature selection and logistic regression on text via new streaming expressions: "features" and "train"

bin/solr script

  * Add basic auth support to the bin/solr script

  * File operations to/from Zookeeper are now supported

SolrCloud

  * New tag 'role' in replica placement rules, e.g. rule=role:!overseer keeps new repicas off overseer nodes

  * CDCR: fall back to whole-index replication when tlogs are insufficient

  * New REPLACENODE command to decommission an existing node and replace it with another new node

  * New DELETENODE command to delete all replicas on a node

Security

  * Add Kerberos delegation token support

  * Support secure impersonation / proxy user for Kerberos authentication

Misc changes

  * A large number of regressions were fixed in the new Admin UI

  * New boolean comparison function queries comparing numeric arguments: gt, gte, lt, lte, eq

  * Upgraded Extraction module to Apache Tika 1.13.

  * Updated to Hadoop 2.7.2
