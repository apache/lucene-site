The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 6.6.4

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the
Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics, rich document parsing,
geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well as parallel SQL. Solr is
enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable, providing fault tolerant
distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation
features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

This release includes a bug fix since the 6.6.3 release:

* Do not allow to use absolute URIs for including other files in solrconfig.xml and schema parsing
