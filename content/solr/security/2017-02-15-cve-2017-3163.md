**CVE-2017-3163: Apache Solr ReplicationHandler path traversal attack**

**Severity:** Moderate

**Vendor:**  
The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**  
Solr 1.4 to 6.4.0

**Description:**  
When using the Index Replication feature, Solr nodes can pull index files from
a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name. However,
Solr did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a special
request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server
process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules
and/or authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users
would gain direct HTTP access.

**Mitigation:**

* 6.x users should upgrade to 6.4.1
* 5.x users should upgrade to 5.5.4
* 4.x, 3.x and 1.4 users should upgrade to a supported version of Solr or setup proper firewalling, or disable the ReplicationHandler if not in use.
