The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 7.7.0

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the
Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document
(e.g., Word, PDF) handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing fault
tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features of
many of the world's largest internet sites.
