The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.4.2 and Apache Solr 6.4.2.

Lucene can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/6.4.2>
and Solr can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/solr/6.4.2>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

  * Fixed: CommonGramsQueryFilter was producing a disconnected token graph, messing up phrase queries during query parsing

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

  * Fixed: Serious performance degradation in Solr 6.4 due to the metrics collection. IndexWriter metrics collection turned off by default, directory level metrics collection completely removed (until a better design is found)

  * Fixed: Transaction log replay can hit an NullPointerException due to new Metrics code

  * Fixed: NullPointerException in CloudSolrClient when reading stale alias

  * Fixed: UnifiedHighlighter and PostingsHighlighter bug in PrefixQuery and TermRangeQuery for multi-byte text
