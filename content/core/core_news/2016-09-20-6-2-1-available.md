The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.2.1

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly
any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

* LUCENE-7417: The standard Highlighter could throw an !IllegalArgumentException when trying to highlight a query containing a degenerate case of a !MultiPhraseQuery with one term.

* LUCENE-7440: Document id skipping (!PostingsEnum.advance) could throw an !ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception on large index segments (>1.8B docs) with large skips.

* LUCENE-7318: Fix backwards compatibility issues around StandardAnalyzer and its components, introduced with Lucene 6.2.0. The moved classes were restored in their original packages: LowercaseFilter and StopFilter, as well as several utility classes.

The release is available for immediate download at:

release for a full list of changes and further details.
