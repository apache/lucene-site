The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 6.4.2.

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics,
rich document parsing, geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well
as parallel SQL. Solr is enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable,
providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers
the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest
internet sites.

Solr 6.4.2 is available for immediate download at:
<https://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html>

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

  * Fixed: Serious performance degradation in Solr 6.4 due to the metrics collection. IndexWriter metrics collection turned off by default, directory level metrics collection completely removed (until a better design is found)

  * Fixed: Transaction log replay can hit an NullPointerException due to new Metrics code

  * Fixed: NullPointerException in CloudSolrClient when reading stale alias

  * Fixed: UnifiedHighlighter and PostingsHighlighter bug in PrefixQuery and TermRangeQuery for multi-byte text

See the [Solr CHANGES.txt](/solr/6_4_2/changes/Changes.html) files included
with the release for a full list of details.
