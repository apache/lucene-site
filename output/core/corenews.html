<p>Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.</p>

<p>Lucene 8.7 Release Highlights:
Better compression of stored fields. Stored fields now use dictionaries in order to improve the compression ratio when there is a lot of redundancy across documents. This works for both the BEST_SPEED and the BEST_COMPRESSION modes.</p>
<p>Faster sorting by field. When a doc-value field is also indexed with points, Lucene now takes advantage of this points index in order to skip documents whose sort value is not competitive.</p>
<p>Faster flushing of stored fields when index sorting is enabled. This can significantly speed up indexing when a non-negligible amount of data is stored in the index and index sorting is enabled.</p>

    <p>The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 8.0.0.</p>
<p>Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.</p>
<p>This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and improvements, some of which are highlighted below. The release is available for immediate download at:</p>

<h3 id="lucene-800-release-highlights">Lucene 8.0.0 Release Highlights:</h3>
<h4 id="query-execution">Query execution</h4>
<p>Term queries, phrase queries and boolean queries introduced new optimization that enables efficient skipping over non-competitive documents when the total hit count is not needed. Depending on the exact query and data distribution, queries might run between a few percents slower and many times faster, especially term queries and pure disjunctions.</p>
<p>In order to support this enhancement, some API changes have been made:
 * TopDocs.totalHits is no longer a long but an object that gives a lower bound of the actual hit count.
 * IndexSearcher's search and searchAfter methods now only compute total hit counts accurately up to 1,000 in order to enable this optimization by default.
 * Queries are now required to produce non-negative scores.</p>
<h4 id="codecs">Codecs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Postings now index score impacts alongside skip data. This is how term queries optimize collection of top hits when hit counts are not needed.</li>
<li>Doc values introduced jump tables, so that advancing runs in constant time. This is especially helpful on sparse fields.</li>
<li>The terms index FST is now loaded off-heap for non-primary-key fields using MMapDirectory, reducing heap usage for such fields.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="custom-scoring">Custom scoring</h4>
<p>The new FeatureField allows efficient integration of static features such as a pagerank into the score. Furthermore, the new LongPoint#newDistanceFeatureQuery and LatLonPoint#newDistanceFeatureQuery methods allow boosting by recency and geo-distance respectively. These new helpers are optimized for the case when total hit counts are not needed. For instance if the pagerank has a significant weight in your scores, then Lucene might be able to skip over documents that have a low pagerank value.</p>

<h3 id="lucene-700-release-highlights">Lucene 7.0.0 Release Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Doc values switched from random access to iterators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 7.0 codec now sparsely encodes sparse doc values and length normalization factors ("norms"), which also translates to optimization in both indexing, and search on sparse values. With these changes, you finally only pay for what you actually use with doc values, in index size, indexing performance, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Index time boost for documents is now removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substantial performance gains for delete and update heavy Lucene usage; see http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2017/07/lucene-gets-concurrent-deletes-and.html for details</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query scoring is now simpler with removal of coord factor, and query normalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classic query parser no longer splits on whitespaces.  This enables better multi-word synonym support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The version of Lucene that created the index segment would be recorded, along with the version that last modified the index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IndexWriter, used to add, update and delete documents in your index, will no longer accept broken token offsets sometimes produced by mis-behaving token filters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IndexReader exposes methods that are typically used to manage resources whose lifetime needs to mimic the lifetime of segments/indexes, typically caches. They have been made much less trappy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dimensional points API now takes a field name up front to offer per-field points access, matching how the doc values APIs work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PostingsHighlighter was removed.  Migrating to the UnifiedHighlighter should be straight-forward.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apache Lucene was tested to be fully compatible with the release of Java 9 and its module system Jigsaw, coming out tomorrow on September 21st!</p>

<p>Points do not store the implicit split dimension in the 1-dimension case. This saves between 6% memory for the largest types such an InetAddressPoint to 33% for the smaller types such as HalfFloatPoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BKD in-memory index for dimensional points now uses a compressed format, using substantially less RAM in some cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BKD writing now buffers each leaf block in heap before writing to disk, giving a small speedup in points-heavy use cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"TermAutomatonQuery" now rewrites to more efficient queries when possible</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, this release cannot be built from source with Java 8 update 121,
use an earlier version instead! This is caused by a bug introduced into the
Javadocs tool shipped with that update. The workaround was too late for this
Lucene release. Of course, you can use the binary artifacts.</p>

<p>Lucene 5.2.0 release highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Span queries now share document conjunction/intersection code with boolean queries, and use two-phased iterators for faster intersection by avoiding loading positions in certain cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added two-phase support to SpanNotQuery, and SpanPositionCheckQuery and its subclasses: SpanPositionRangeQuery, SpanPayloadCheckQuery, SpanNearPayloadCheckQuery, SpanFirstQuery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a new query time join to the join module that uses global ordinals, which is faster for subsequent joins between reopens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New CompositeSpatialStrategy combines speed of RPT with accuracy of SDV. Includes optimized Intersect predicate to avoid many geometry checks. Uses TwoPhaseIterator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New LimitTokenOffsetFilter that limits tokens to those before a configured maximum start offset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New spatial PackedQuadPrefixTree, a generally more efficient choice than QuadPrefixTree, especially for high precision shapes. When used, you should typically disable RPT's pruneLeafyBranches option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expressions now support bindings keys that look like zero arg functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add SpanWithinQuery and SpanContainingQuery that return spans inside of / containing another spans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Spatial "Geo3d" API with partial Spatial4j integration. It is a set of shapes implemented using 3D planar geometry for calculating spatial relations on the surface of a sphere. Shapes include Point, BBox, Circle, Path (buffered line string), and Polygon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various bugfixes and optimizations since the 5.1.0 release.</p>

<p>Lucene 5.0 Release Highlights:</p>
<p>Stronger index safety</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All file access now uses Java’s NIO.2 APIs which give Lucene stronger index safety in terms of better error handling and safer commits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every Lucene segment now stores a unique id per-segment and per-commit to aid in accurate replication of index files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During merging, IndexWriter now always checks the incoming segments for corruption before merging. This can mean, on upgrading to 5.0.0, that merging may uncover long-standing latent corruption in an older 4.x index.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reduced heap usage</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lucene now supports random-writable and advance-able sparse bitsets (RoaringDocIdSet and SparseFixedBitSet), so the heap required is in proportion to how many bits are set, not how many total documents exist in the index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heap usage during IndexWriter merging is also much lower with the new Lucene50Codec, since doc values and norms for the segments being merged are no longer fully loaded into heap for all fields; now they are loaded for the one field currently being merged, and then dropped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default norms format now uses sparse encoding when appropriate, so indices that enable norms for many sparse fields will see a large reduction in required heap at search time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5.0 has a new API to print a tree structure showing a recursive breakdown of which parts are using how much heap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FieldCache is gone (moved to a dedicated UninvertingReader in the misc module). This means when you intend to sort on a field, you should index that field using doc values, which is much faster and less heap consuming than FieldCache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tokenizers and Analyzers no longer require Reader on init.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NormsFormat now gets its own dedicated NormsConsumer/Producer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SortedSetSortField, used to sort on a multi-valued field, is promoted from sandbox to Lucene's core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PostingsFormat now uses a "pull" API when writing postings, just like doc values. This is powerful because you can do things in your postings format that require making more than one pass through the postings such as iterating over all postings for each term to decide which compression format it should use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New DateRangeField type enables Indexing and searching of date ranges, particularly multi-valued ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new ExitableDirectoryReader extends FilterDirectoryReader and enables exiting requests that take too long to enumerate over terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggesters from multi-valued field can now be built as DocumentDictionary now enumerates each value separately in a multi-valued field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ConcurrentMergeScheduler detects whether the index is on SSD or not and does a better job defaulting its settings. This only works on Linux for now; other OS's will continue to use the previous defaults (tuned for spinning disks).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-IO-throttling has been added to ConcurrentMergeScheduler, to rate limit IO writes for each merge depending on incoming merge rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CustomAnalyzer has been added that allows to configure analyzers like you do in Solr's index schema. This class has a builder API to configure Tokenizers, TokenFilters, and CharFilters based on their SPI names and parameters as documented by the corresponding factories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory index now supports payloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a filter cache with a usage tracking policy that caches filters based on frequency of use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default codec has an option to control BEST_SPEED or BEST_COMPRESSION for stored fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stored fields are merged more efficiently, especially when upgrading from previous versions or using SortingMergePolicy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Lucene 5 no longer supports the Lucene 3.x index format. Opening indexes will result in IndexFormatTooOldException. It is recommended to either reindex all your data, or upgrade the old indexes with the IndexUpgrader tool of latest Lucene 4 version (4.10.x). Those indexes can then be read (see next section) with Lucene 5.</p>

<h3 id="lucene-480-release-highlights">Lucene 4.8.0 Release Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apache Lucene now requires Java 7 or greater (recommended is
  Oracle Java 7 or OpenJDK 7, minimum update 55; earlier versions
  have known JVM bugs affecting Lucene).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apache Lucene is fully compatible with Java 8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All index files now store end-to-end checksums, which are
  now validated during merging and reading. This ensures that
  corruptions caused by any bit-flipping hardware problems or bugs
  in the JVM can be detected earlier.  For full detection be sure
  to enable all checksums during merging (it's disabled by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lucene has a new Rescorer/QueryRescorer API to perform second-pass
  rescoring or reranking of search results using more expensive scoring
  functions after first-pass hit collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AnalyzingInfixSuggester now supports near-real-time autosuggest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplified impact-sorted postings (using SortingMergePolicy and
  EarlyTerminatingCollector) to use Lucene's Sort class
  to express the sort order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bulk scoring and normal iterator-based scoring were separated,
  so some queries can do bulk scoring more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switched to MurmurHash3 to hash terms during indexing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IndexWriter now supports updating of binary doc value fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HunspellStemFilter now uses 10 to 100x less RAM. It also loads
  all known OpenOffice dictionaries without error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lucene now also fsyncs the directory metadata on commits, if the
  operating system and file system allow it (Linux, MacOSX are
  known to work).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lucene now uses Java 7 file system functions under the hood,
  so index files can be deleted on Windows, even when readers are
  still open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A serious bug in NativeFSLockFactory was fixed, which could
  allow multiple IndexWriters to acquire the same lock.  The
  lock file is no longer deleted from the index directory
  even when the lock is not held.</p>

      <a class="headerlink" href="#apache-lucene-48-will-require-java-7" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The Apache Lucene committers decided with a large majority on the vote to require <strong>Java 7</strong> for the next minor release of Apache Lucene (version 4.8)!</p>
<p>The next release will also contain some improvements for Java 7:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Better file handling (especially on Windows) in the directory implementations. Files can now be deleted on windows, although the index is still open - like it was always possible on Unix environments (delete on last close semantics).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed improvements in sorting comparators: Sorting now uses Java 7's own comparators for integer and long sorts, which are highly optimized by the Hotspot VM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to stay up-to-date with Lucene and Solr, you should upgrade your infrastructure to Java 7.
Please be aware that you must use at least use Java 7u1.
The recommended version at the moment is Java 7u25. Later versions like 7u40, 7u45,... have a bug causing index corrumption.
Ideally use the Java 7u60 prerelease, which has fixed this bug. Once 7u60 is out, this will be the recommended version.
In addition, there is no more Oracle/BEA JRockit available for Java 7, use the official Oracle Java 7.
JRockit was never working correctly with Lucene/Solr (causing index corrumption), so this should not be an issue.
Please also review our list of JVM bugs: <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs">http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs</a></p>
<p><em>EDIT (as of 15 April 2014):</em> The recently released Java 7u55 fixes the above bug causing index corrumption.
This version is now the recommended version for running Apache Lucene.</p>

      26 February 2014 - Lucene Core 4.7 Available

    </h2>
    <p>The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 4.7</p>
<p>Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly
any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.</p>
<p>This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and
improvements, some of which are highlighted below. The release
is available for immediate download at:
  <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/mirrors-core-latest-redir.html">https://lucene.apache.org/core/mirrors-core-latest-redir.html</a></p>
<p>See the <a href="/core/4_7_0/changes/Changes.html">CHANGES.txt</a> file included
with the release for a full list of details.</p>
<h3 id="lucene-47-release-highlights">Lucene 4.7 Release Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When sorting by String (SortField.STRING), you can now specify whether missing values should be sorted first (the default), or last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add two memory resident dictionaries (FST terms dictionary and FSTOrd
  terms dictionary) to improve primary key lookups. The
  PostingsBaseFormat API is also changed so that term dictionaries get
  the ability to block encode term metadata, and all dictionary
  implementations can now plug in any PostingsBaseFormat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NRT support for file systems that do not have delete on last close or cannot delete while referenced semantics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add LongBitSet for managing more than 2.1B bits (otherwise use FixedBitSet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed up Lucene range faceting from O(N) per hit to O(log(N)) per hit using segment trees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add SearcherTaxonomyManager over search and taxonomy index directories
  (i.e. not only NRT).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drilling down or sideways on a Lucene facet range (using
  Range.getFilter()) is now faster for costly filters (uses random
  access, not iteration); range facet counts now accept a fast-match
  filter to avoid computing the value for documents that are out of
  bounds, e.g. using a bounding box filter with distance range faceting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Analyzer for Kurdish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Payload support to FileDictionary (Suggest) and make it more configurable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a new BlendedInfixSuggester, which is like AnalyzingInfixSuggester but boosts suggestions that matched tokens with lower positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add SimpleQueryParser: parser for human-entered queries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add multitermquery (wildcards,prefix,etc) to PostingsHighlighter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade to Spatial4j 0.4.1: Parses WKT (including ENVELOPE) with extension BUFFER; buffering a point results in a Circle. JTS isn't
  needed for WKT any more but remains required for Polygons. New Shapes: ShapeCollection and BufferedLineString.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add spatial SerializedDVStrategy that serializes a binary
  representation of a shape into BinaryDocValues. It supports exact
  geometry relationship calculations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various bugfixes and optimizations since the 4.6.1 release.</p>
</li>
