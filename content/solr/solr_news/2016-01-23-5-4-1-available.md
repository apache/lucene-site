The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 5.4.1

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic
clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF)
handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing
fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search
and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 5.4.1 is available for immediate download at:
<https://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html>

This release especially contains a fix for a faceting bug that could
cause facet counts to include deleted documents and a fix for a
corruption bug that was introduced in version 5.4.0. If you are on
5.4.0 and using BINARY, SORTED_NUMERIC or SORTED_SET doc values,
upgrading to 5.4.1 is strongly recommended.

See the [CHANGES.txt](/solr/5_4_1/changes/Changes.html)
file included with the release for a full list of details.
