# Web site for Apache Lucene and Solr

This repository contains the "source code" of the Lucene/Solr website at [lucene.apache.org](https://lucene.apache.org/).

## Building the site

The site is written in [Markdown][9] syntax and built into a static site using [Pelican][1]. The site is re-built automatically by [ASF Buildbot][5] on every push to master branch and the result can be previewed at [lucene.staged.apache.org][6]. Build success/failure emails are sent to [commits@lucene.apache.org][7] mailing list. Read more about the mechanics behind auto building in [INFRA Confluence][8].
 
If the staged site looks good, simply merge the changes to branch `production` and the site will be deployed in a minute or two.

For larger edits it is recommended to build and preview the site locally. This is much faster. The next sections detail that procedure. The TL;DR instructions goes like this:

    # Usage: ./build.sh [-l] [<other pelican arguments>]
    #        -l     Live build and reload source changes on localhost:8000
    #        --help Show full help for options that Pelican accepts
    ./build -l

Now go to <http://localhost:8000> to view the beautiful Lucene web page served from your laptop with live-preview of updates :)

### Installing Pelican by hand

The site uses [Pelican][1] for static html generation. Pelican requires [Python 3.5+][4] and can be installed with pip.

**The `build.sh` script mentioned in the above paragraph takes care of setting up your Pelican environment,** and you can skip this part unless you want to understand the moving parts and install things by hand. Assuming that you have python3 installed, simply run:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you run into conflicts with existing packages, a solution is to use a virtual Python environment. See the [Pelican installation page][2] for more details. These are quick commands, Linux flavor:

```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once Pelican is installed you can convert your content into HTML via the pelican command (`content` is the default location to build from).

```sh
pelican
```

The above command will generate your site and save it in the `output/` folder using the lucene theme and settings defined in `pelicanconf.py`

You can also tell Pelican to watch for your modifications, instead of manually re-running it every time you want to see your changes. To enable this, run the pelican command with the `-r` or `--autoreload` option. On non-Windows environments, this option can also be combined with the `-l` or `--listen` option to simultaneously both auto-regenerate and serve the output through a builtin webserver on <http://localhost:8000>.

```sh
pelican --autoreload --listen
```

Remember that on Mac/Linux you can use the `build.sh` script with `-l` option to do the same.

## Updating site during a Lucene/Solr release

The release manager documentation will contain detailed instructions on how to update the site during a release. Some of the boring version number update and download link generation is handled by Pelican, see below.

JavaDoc publishing and Solr RefGuide publishing is handled in a special way and are not checked in to this repository. More details will follow. 

### Bump Lucene/Solr latest version after the release

There are variables in **pelicanconf.py** to modify the latest 2 supported release versions. This will affect all references to release version in the theme, but not in pages or articles. Pelican views pages and articles as static write-once, like a blog post, whereas the theme can be more dynamic and change with every build.

Modify `LUCENE_LATEST_RELEASE` and `LUCENE_PREVIOUS_MAJOR_RELEASE`, and
`LUCENE_LATEST_RELEASE_DATE` to affect

* Full patch release versions in html such as "6.3.0".
* Minor release versions in html such as "6.3.x".
* References to unsupported versions such as "<6" in [Solr downloads][3].
* References to upcoming unreleased versions such as "7" in [Solr downloads][3]
  which is a +1 increment of the `LUCENE_LATEST_RELEASE` setting.
* Links to source, javadocs, PGP, and SHA512 which use underscores to separate
  version parts such as `6_3_0`
* References to the release date of the latest version which can be dynamically
  formatted for different pages.
