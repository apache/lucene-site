## What is PyLucene ?

PyLucene is a [Python](https://www.python.org) extension for accessing Java
[Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/java/)â„¢. Its goal
is to allow you to use Lucene's text indexing and searching capabilities from
Python. It is API compatible with Java Lucene version 9.4.1 as of November 7th,
2022.

PyLucene is not a Lucene port but a Python wrapper around Java Lucene. PyLucene
embeds a Java VM with Lucene into a Python process. The PyLucene Python extension,
a Python module called **lucene** is machine-generated by JCC.

PyLucene is built with [JCC](jcc/index.html), a C++ code generator that makes it
possible to call into Java classes from Python via Java's Native Invocation
Interface (JNI). Sources for JCC are included with the PyLucene sources.

See [here](features.html) for more information and documentation about PyLucene.

## Requirements

PyLucene is supported on macOS, Linux, Solaris and Windows.

PyLucene requires Python 3.x (x >= 3), and Java x (x >= 8 for PyLucene 8 and
earlier, x >= 11 for PyLucene 9).
Python 2 support is untested since PyLucene 9.4.1 / JCC 3.13.
Building PyLucene requires GNU Make and a C++ compiler. Use of
[setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) is recommended.

See the JCC [installation](jcc/install.html) instructions for more information
about building JCC from sources.

See the PyLucene [installation instructions](install.html) for more information
about building PyLucene from sources.
