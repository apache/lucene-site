The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 9.6.0.

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires structured search, full-text search, faceting, nearest-neighbor search across high-dimensionality vectors, spell correction or query suggestions.

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and improvements, some of which are highlighted below. The release is available for immediate download at:

  <https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html>

### Lucene 9.6.0 Release Highlights:

* Introduce a new KeywordField for simple and efficient filtering, sorting and faceting.
* Add support for Java 20 foreign memory API. If exactly Java 19 or 20 is used, MMapDirectory will mmap Lucene indexes in chunks of 16 GiB (instead of 1 GiB) and indexes closed while queries are running can no longer crash the JVM.
* Improved performance for TermInSetQuery, PrefixQuery, WildcardQuery and TermRangeQuery
* Lower memory usage for BloomFilteringPostingsFormat
* Faster merges for HNSW indexes
* Improvements to concurrent indexing throughput under heavy load
* Correct equals implementation in SynonymQuery
* 'explain' is now implemented on TermAutomatonQuery
