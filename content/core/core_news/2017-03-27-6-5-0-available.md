The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.5.0

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly
any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and
improvements, some of which are highlighted below.
The release is available for immediate download at:

  <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/6.5.0>

See the [CHANGES.txt](/core/6_5_0/changes/Changes.html) file included with the
release for a full list of changes and further details.

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

 * It is now possible filter out duplicates in the NRT suggester

 * SimpleQueryString now supports default fuziness

 * IndexWriter can return the list of visible field names

 * DisjunctionScorer now supports returning the matching children clauses

 * A new FunctionScoreQuery that modifies the internal query's score using the per-document values

 * A new FunctionMatchQuery that returns any documents with a value that matches a predicate

 * A new WordDelimiterGraphFilter that outputs a correct graph structure for multi-token expansion at query time

 * A new PatternTokenizer that uses Lucene's RegExp implementation

 * RangeFieldQuery now supports CROSSES relation

 * A new IndexOrDocValuesQuery that uses either an index (points or terms) or doc values in order to run a (range, geo box and distance) query, depending which one is more efficient

 * index-time boosts are deprecated

 * Term filters are no longer cached

 * Compound filters are cached earlier than regular queries

 * BKDReader now calls grow on larger increments

 * LatLonPointInPolygonQuery are faster

 * LatLonPointDistanceQuery now skips distance computations more often

 * To-parent block joins now implements two-phase iteration

 * Point ranges that match most documents are faster

 * PointValues#estimatePointCount is faster with Relation.CELL_INSIDE_QUERY

 * Segments are now also sorted during flush, and merging on a sorted index is substantially faster by using some of the same bulk merge optimizations that non-sorted merging uses
