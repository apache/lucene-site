The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.6.1

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly
any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.

The release is available for immediate download at:

   <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/6.6.1>

See the [CHANGES.txt](/core/6_6_1/changes/Changes.html) file included with the
release for a full list of changes and further details.

This release contains 2 bug fixes since the 6.6.0 release:

 * Documents with multiple points that should match might not match on a memory index

 * A query which has only one synonym with AND as the default operator would
   wrongly translate as an AND between the query term and the synonym
