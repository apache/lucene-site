The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.0.1

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly
any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.

This release contains 10 bug fixes since the 6.0.0 release, and one new feature:

  * Spatial-extras DateRangePrefixTree's Calendar is now configurable, to e.g. clear the Gregorian Change Date. Also, toString(cal) is now identical to DateTimeFormatter.ISO_INSTANT.

The release is available for immediate download at:

See the [CHANGES.txt](/core/6_0_1/changes/Changes.html) file included with the
release for a full list of changes and further details.
