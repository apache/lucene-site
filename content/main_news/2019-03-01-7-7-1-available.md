The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 7.7.1 and Apache Solr 7.7.1

Lucene can be downloaded from <https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html>
and Solr can be downloaded from <https://lucene.apache.org/solr/downloads.html>

This Lucene release contains no change over Lucene 7.7.0.

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

 * Bugfix for ClassCastException when URPs try to read a String field which returns a ByteArrayUTF8CHarSequence (a
   regression in release 7.7.0).

 * Bugfix: Autoscaling based replica placement was broken out of the box. Solr 7.5 enabled autoscaling based replica
   placement by default but in the absence of default cluster policies, autoscaling can place more than 1 replica of the
   same shard on the same node. Also, the maxShardsPerNode and createNodeSet was not respected. Due to these reasons,
   this issue reverts the default replica placement policy to the 'legacy' assignment policy that was the default until
   Solr 7.4.
