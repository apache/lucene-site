The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 7.7.1

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the
Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document
(e.g., Word, PDF) handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing fault
tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features of
many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 7.7.1 is available for immediate download at:

### Solr 7.7.1 Release Highlights:

 * Bugfix for ClassCastException when URPs try to read a String field which returns a ByteArrayUTF8CHarSequence (a
   regression in release 7.7.0).

 * Bugfix: Autoscaling based replica placement was broken out of the box. Solr 7.6 enabled autoscaling based replica
   placement by default but in the absence of default cluster policies, autoscaling can place more than 1 replica of the
   same shard on the same node. Also, the maxShardsPerNode and createNodeSet was not respected. Due to these reasons,
   this issue reverts the default replica placement policy to the 'legacy' assignment policy that was the default until
   Solr 7.5.
