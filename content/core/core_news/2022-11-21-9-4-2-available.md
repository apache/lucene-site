The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 9.4.2.

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires structured search, full-text search, faceting, nearest-neighbor search across high-dimensionality vectors, spell correction or query suggestions.

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and improvements, some of which are highlighted below. The release is available for immediate download at:

  <https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html>

### Lucene 9.4.2 Release Highlights:

 * Fixed integer overflow when opening segments containing more than ~16M KNN vectors.
 * Fixed cost computation of BitSets created via DocIdSetBuilder, such as for multi-term queries. This may improve performance of multi-term queries.
 * CheckIndex now verifies the consistency of KNN vectors more thoroughly.
