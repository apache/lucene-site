The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 6.5.0.

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics,
rich document parsing, geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well
as parallel SQL. Solr is enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable,
providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers
the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest
internet sites.
