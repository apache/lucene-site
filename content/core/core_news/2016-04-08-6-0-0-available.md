The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.0.0.

The release can be downloaded from <https://lucene.apache.org/core/mirrors-core-latest-redir.html>

Release Highlights:

  * Java 8 is the minimum Java version required.

  * Dimensional points, replacing legacy numeric fields, provides fast and space-efficient support for both single- and multi-dimension range and shape filtering.  This includes numeric (int, float, long, double), InetAddress, BigInteger and binary range filtering, as well as geo-spatial shape search over indexed 2D LatLonPoints.  See [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/lucene-points-6.0) for details.  Dependent classes and modules (e.g., MemoryIndex, Spatial Strategies, Join module) have been refactored to use new point types.

  * Lucene classification module now works on Lucene Documents using a KNearestNeighborClassifier or SimpleNaiveBayesClassifier.

  * The spatial module no longer depends on third-party libraries. Previous spatial classes have been moved to a new spatial-extras module.

  * Spatial4j has been updated to a new 0.6 version hosted by locationtech.

  * TermsQuery performance boost by a more aggressive default query caching policy.

  * IndexSearcher's default Similarity is now changed to BM25Similarity.

  * Easier method of defining custom CharTokenizer instances.
