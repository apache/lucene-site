The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 10.2.1.

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires structured search, full-text search, faceting, nearest-neighbor search across high-dimensionality vectors, spell correction or query suggestions.

This patch release contains bug fixes that are highlighted below. The release is available for immediate download at:

<https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html>

### Lucene 10.2.1 Release Highlights

#### Bug fixes

 * Fix DISIDocIdStream::count so that it does not try to count beyond max.
 * Correct TermOrdValComparator competitive iterator so that it forces sparse field iteration to be at least scoring window baseline when doing intoBitSet.
 * Provide better impacts for fields indexed with IndexOptions.DOCS
 * Fixed lead cost computations for bulk scorers of conjunctive queries that mix MUST and FILTER clauses, and disjunctive queries that configure a minimum number of matching SHOULD clauses.
