The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 5.5.3

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic
clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF)
handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing
fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search
and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

This release includes 5 bug fixes since the 5.5.2 release.

This release specially contains 2 critical fixes:
* The number of TCP connections in CLOSE_WAIT state do not spike during indexing,
* PeerSync no longer fails on a node restart due to IndexFingerPrint mismatch.
