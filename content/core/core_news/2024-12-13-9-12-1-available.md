The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 9.12.1.

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires structured search, full-text search, faceting, nearest-neighbor search across high-dimensionality vectors, spell correction or query suggestions.

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and improvements, some of which are highlighted below. The release is available for immediate download at:

  <https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html>

### Lucene 9.12.1 Release Highlights:

#### Improvements
 * Allow easier configuration of the Panama vectorization provider with newer Java versions. Set the org.apache.lucene.vectorization.upperJavaFeatureVersion system property to increase the set of Java versions that Panama vectorization will provide optimized implementations for.

#### Bug fixes
 * Fixed backwards compatibility bug that caused sparse (not all documents have a vector) KNN indices written with 9.0.0 to give silently (no exception) terrible recall results when searched by any 9.x release
 * Improve Tessellatorlogic when two holes share the same vertex with the polygon which was failing in valid polygons.
 * Fix backwards compatibility bug that caused 9.12.0 to incorrectly throw IllegalStateException when trying to open an IndexReader on an index created with quantized (int4, int7, int8) KNN vectors using Lucene99HnswScalarQuantizedVectorsFormat.
