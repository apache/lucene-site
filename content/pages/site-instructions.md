## Editing Content on the Luceneâ„¢ sites
The web site is hosted in its own git repository **lucene-site** (see [Github](https://github.com/apache/lucene-site) and [Gitbox](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucene-site.git)).

Pushing to the `main` branch will update the staging site while pushing to `production` branch will update the main web site. Read the `README.md` file for further instructions.

For reporting website-related issues or suggesting improvements, please visit our [Issue Tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LUCENE).
