Solr 5.3 Release Highlights:

 * In addition to many other improvements in the security framework, Solr now includes an AuthenticationPlugin implementing HTTP Basic Auth that stores credentials securely in ZooKeeper. This is a simple way to require a username and password for anyone accessing Solrâ€™s admin screen or APIs.
 * In built AuthorizationPlugin that provides fine grained control over implementing ACLs for various resources with permisssion rules which are stored in ZooKeeper.
 * The JSON Facet API can now change the domain for facet commands, essentially doing a block join and moving from parents to children, or children to parents before calculating the facet data.
 * Major improvements in performance of the new Facet Module / JSON Facet API.
 * Query and Range Facets under Pivot Facets. Just like the JSON Facet API, pivot facets can how nest other facet types such as range and query facets.
 * More Like This Query Parser options. The MoreLikeThis QParser now supports all options provided by the MLT Handler. The query parser is much more versatile than the handler as it works in cloud mode as well as anywhere a normal query can be specified.
 * Added Schema API support in SolrJ
 * Added Scoring mode for query-time join and block join.
 * Added Smile response format
