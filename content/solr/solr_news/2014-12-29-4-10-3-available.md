The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 4.10.3

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic
clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF)
handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing
fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search
and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 4.10.3 is available for immediate download at:
<https://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html>

Solr 4.10.3 includes 21 bug fixes, 5 other changes,
as well as Lucene 4.10.3 and its 12 bug fixes.

This release fixes the following security vulnerability that has affected
Solr since the Solr 4.0 Alpha release.

CVE-2014-3628: Stored XSS vulnerability in Solr Admin UI.

Information disclosure: The Solr Admin UI Plugin / Stats page does not escape
data values which allows an attacker to execute javascript by executing a query
that will be stored and displayed via the 'fieldvaluecache' object.

See the [CHANGES.txt](/solr/4_10_3/changes/Changes.html)
file included with the release for a full list of details, and Happy
Holidays!
