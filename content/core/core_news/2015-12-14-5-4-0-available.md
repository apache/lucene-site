The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 5.4.0

The release can be downloaded from <https://lucene.apache.org/core/mirrors-core-latest-redir.html>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:
####API Changes
* Query.getBoost and Query.setBoost are deprecated in favour of the new BoostQuery
* The Filter class is deprecated in favour of FILTER clauses in a BooleanQuery
* DefaultSimilarity has been renamed to ClassicSimilarity to prepare for the move to BM25 in Lucene 6

####New features
* New Serbian token filter
* New DecimalDigitFilter, to fold unicode digits to latin digits
* New UnicodeWhitespaceTokenizer, that uses Unicode's whitespace definition and splits on NBSP
* New GeoPointDistanceRangeQuery to search for geo-points within a ring
* Query caching is now enabled by default in IndexSearcher, use IndexSearcher.setQueryCache(null) to disable

####Optimizations
* MatchAllDocsQuery got faster
* Doc values now use less memory for multi-valued fields and less disk in case of sparse fields
* Two-phase iterators got a match cost API so that the costly bits can be checked last

####Bug fixes
* PatternTokenizer no longer hangs onto heap sized to the maximum input string it's ever seen.
