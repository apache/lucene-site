The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 6.2.1

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic
clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF)
handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing
fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search
and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

This release includes 11 bug fixes since the 6.2.0 release. Some of the major fixes are:

 * SOLR-9490: BoolField always returning false for non-DV fields when javabin involved (via solrj, or intra node communication)

 * SOLR-9188: BlockUnknown property makes inter-node communication impossible

 * SOLR-9389: HDFS Transaction logs stay open for writes which leaks Xceivers

 * SOLR-9438: Shard split can fail to write commit data on shutdown leading to data loss

Furthermore, this release includes Apache Lucene 6.2.1 which includes 3 bug fixes since the 6.2.0 release.
