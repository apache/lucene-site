The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.5.0 and Apache Solr 6.5.0.

Lucene can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/6.5.0>
and Solr can be downloaded from <https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/solr/6.5.0>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

 * It is now possible filter out duplicates in the NRT suggester

 * SimpleQueryString now supports default fuziness

 * IndexWriter can return the list of visible field names

 * DisjunctionScorer now supports returning the matching children clauses

 * A new FunctionScoreQuery that modifies the internal query's score using the per-document values

 * A new FunctionMatchQuery that returns any documents with a value that matches a predicate

 * A new WordDelimiterGraphFilter that outputs a correct graph structure for multi-token expansion at query time

 * A new PatternTokenizer that uses Lucene's RegExp implementation

 * RangeFieldQuery now supports CROSSES relation

 * A new IndexOrDocValuesQuery that uses either an index (points or terms) or doc values in order to run a (range, geo box and distance) query, depending which one is more efficient

 * index-time boosts are deprecated

 * Term filters are no longer cached

 * Compound filters are cached earlier than regular queries

 * BKDReader now calls grow on larger increments

 * LatLonPointInPolygonQuery are faster

 * LatLonPointDistanceQuery now skips distance computations more often

 * To-parent block joins now implements two-phase iteration

 * Point ranges that match most documents are faster

 * PointValues#estimatePointCount is faster with Relation.CELL_INSIDE_QUERY

 * Segments are now also sorted during flush, and merging on a sorted index is substantially faster by using some of the same bulk merge optimizations that non-sorted merging uses

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

 * PointFields (fixed-width multi-dimensional numeric & binary types enabling fast range search) are now supported

 * In-place updates to numeric docValues fields (single valued, non-stored, non-indexed) supported using atomic update syntax

 * A new LatLonPointSpatialField that uses points or doc values for query

 * It is now possible to declare a field as "large" in order to bypass the document cache

 * New sow=false request param (split-on-whitespace) for edismax & standard query parsers enables query-time multi-term synonyms

 * XML QueryParser (defType=xmlparser) now supports span queries

 * hl.maxAnalyzedChars now have consistent default across highlighters

 * UnifiedSolrHighlighter and PostingsSolrHighlighter now support CustomSeparatorBreakIterator

 * Scoring formula is adjusted for the scoreNodes function

 * Calcite Planner now applies constant Reduction Rules to optimize plans

 * A new significantTerms Streaming Expression that is able to extract the significant terms in an index

 * StreamHandler is now able to use runtimeLib jars

 * Arithmetic operations are added to the SelectStream

 * Added modernized self-documenting /v2 API

 * The .system collection is now created on first request if it does not exist

 * Admin UI: Added shard deletion button

 * Metrics API now supports non-numeric metrics (version, disk type, component state, system properties...)

 * The disk free and aggregated disk free metrics are now reported

 * The DirectUpdateHandler2 now implements MetricsProducer and exposes stats via the metrics api and configured reporters.

 * BlockCache is faster due to less failures when caching a new block

 * MMapDirectoryFactory now supports "preload" option to ask mapped pages to be loaded into physical memory on init

 * Security: BasicAuthPlugin now supports standalone mode

 * Arbitrary java system properties can be passed to zkcli

 * SolrHttpClientBuilder can be configured via java system property

 * Javadocs and Changes.html are no longer included in the binary distribution, but are hosted online
